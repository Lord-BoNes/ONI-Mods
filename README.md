# ONI-Mods
Welcome to my Oxygen Not Included GitHub repository.
This is mainly here incase Steam decides to have issues with updating my mods.



# Mods:
#-LiquidConditionerReversed
Adds reverse-cycle versions of the Thermo Regulator and AquaTuner. Instead of cooling the coolant and heating itself, these machines heat the coolant and cool themselves.

The mod also includes HV versions of the regular AquaTuner & Regulator as well as HV versions of the new reverse-cycle machines. The HV versions use substantially more Watts per second but provide much greater cooling efficiency.
